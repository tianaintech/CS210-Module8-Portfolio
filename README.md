# CS210-Module8-Portfolio
Portfolio submission for CS 210 Module Eight Journal.

This project focused on developing a compound interest calculator for Airgead Banking, designed to teach high school students the value of saving and fiscal responsibility. The program calculates and displays investment growth over time, both with and without monthly deposits, helping users understand how their financial decisions can impact long-term savings. One of the strengths of my work was the use of modular, object-oriented programming principles, which made the program organized, maintainable, and easy to debug. Input validation was another area where I excelled, ensuring users could only provide valid data, resulting in a robust and user-friendly application. However, there are areas where the code could be improved. For example, optimizing the loops for better efficiency, adding safeguards against extreme or invalid inputs for enhanced security, and improving the user interface for better clarity and engagement. These enhancements would make the program faster, more secure, and visually appealing.

The most challenging aspect of the project was implementing the compound interest calculations, especially distinguishing between scenarios with and without monthly deposits. To overcome this, I broke the problem into smaller steps and relied on pseudocode planning, C++ documentation, and forums like Stack Overflow. Testing with known cases also helped ensure accuracy. This project strengthened transferable skills, such as problem decomposition, input validation, and object-oriented programming, which will be invaluable for future coursework and professional tasks. Additionally, I made the program maintainable and adaptable by using modular design, clear naming conventions, and in-line comments to explain functionality. The programâ€™s structure allows for easy updates, scalability, and the potential to add new features, ensuring it remains useful for future needs.
